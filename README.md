## Exercise: Filtering and Transforming

### Objective:

- The objective of this exercise is to practice working with lambda expressions in Java. 

### Instructions:

1.	Create a Java class named "LambdaExercise" for this exercise.
2.	Define a class Person with the following attributes: name, age, and city. You'll use this class to represent individuals.
3.	In the "LambdaExercise" class, create a static method named "filterAndTransform" that takes a List of Person objects as input and returns a List of Strings as output. This method should use lambda expressions to perform the following tasks:
    -	Filter out people whose age is greater than 30.
    -	Transform the remaining Person objects into Strings containing their name and city.
4.	In the main method of the "LambdaExercise" class, create a list of Person objects containing various individuals.
5.	Call the "filterAndTransform" method with the created list as an argument.
6.	Print the original list of Person objects, the filtered list, and the transformed list of Strings using lambda expressions.
